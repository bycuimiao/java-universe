In computing, reactive programming is an asynchronous programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change. This means that it becomes possible to express static (e.g. arrays) or dynamic (e.g. event emitters) data streams with ease via the employed programming language(s), and that an inferred dependency within the associated execution model exists, which facilitates the automatic propagation of the change involved with data flow.

以上解释来自维基百科，在计算机领域，响应式编程是一个专注于数据流和变化传递的异步编程范式。这意味着可以使用编程语言很容易地表示静态（例如数组）或动态（例如事件发射器）数据流，并且在关联的执行模型中，存在着可推断的依赖关系，这个关系的存在有利于自动传播与数据流有关的更改。

An easy way of reaching a first intuition about what it's like is to imagine your program is a spreadsheet and all of your variables are cells. If any of the cells in a spreadsheet change, any cells that refer to that cell change as well. It's just the same with FRP.
电子表格比作响应式编程，cell比作数据，这个比喻很好理解  
Reactive patterns fit naturally with message processing (since an event translates nicely into a message), so if there is a way to process more messages faster we should pay attention.  
反应模式自然适合消息处理（因为事件可以很好地转换为消息），因此，如果有一种方法可以更快地处理更多消息，则应引起注意。  
Spreadsheets Perhaps not really an enterprise use case, but one that everyone in the enterprise can easily relate to, and it nicely captures the philosophy of, and difficulty of implementing FRP.
电子表格也许不是真正的企业用例，但企业中的每个人都可以轻松地联系到一个用例，它很好地体现了FRP的理念和实施难度  
It also highlights the difference between FRP and simple event-driven programming — it puts the "intelligent" in "intelligent routing".
它还强调了FRP和简单的事件驱动编程之间的区别-将“智能”置于“智能路由”中。  
Actor Model

Futures are great when all you need is concurrent processing of a set of similar tasks, but as soon as any of them want to depend on each other or execute conditionally you get into a form of "nested callback hell". Reactive Programming provides an antidote to that.
这句话表示了Future和FRP的区别，以及FRP可以解决哪些Future解决不了的问题 nested callback hell

The promise of Reactive is that you can do more with less, specifically you can process higher loads with fewer threads. 

java9开始，官方支持了响应式编程规范，提供了顶级的响应式编程接口。
java11开始，官方提供了支持http2的、友好的http客户端java.net.http，该客户端就是jdk内部第一个基于响应式编程规范的实现。

The term, “reactive,” refers to programming models that are built around reacting to change — network components reacting to I/O events, UI controllers reacting to mouse events, and others.
