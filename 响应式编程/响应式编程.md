In computing, reactive programming is an asynchronous programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change. This means that it becomes possible to express static (e.g. arrays) or dynamic (e.g. event emitters) data streams with ease via the employed programming language(s), and that an inferred dependency within the associated execution model exists, which facilitates the automatic propagation of the change involved with data flow.

以上解释来自维基百科，在计算机领域，响应式编程是一个专注于数据流和变化传递的异步编程范式。这意味着可以使用编程语言很容易地表示静态（例如数组）或动态（例如事件发射器）数据流，并且在关联的执行模型中，存在着可推断的依赖关系，这个关系的存在有利于自动传播与数据流有关的更改。

An easy way of reaching a first intuition about what it's like is to imagine your program is a spreadsheet and all of your variables are cells. If any of the cells in a spreadsheet change, any cells that refer to that cell change as well. It's just the same with FRP.
电子表格比作响应式编程，cell比作数据，这个比喻很好理解  
Reactive patterns fit naturally with message processing (since an event translates nicely into a message), so if there is a way to process more messages faster we should pay attention.  
反应模式自然适合消息处理（因为事件可以很好地转换为消息），因此，如果有一种方法可以更快地处理更多消息，则应引起注意。
